        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Direct-PhD student in the Systems Control Group at the University of Toronto, working with
          <strong>Mireille&nbsp;E. Broucke</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current work focuses on <strong>system identification for stable linear time invariant systems</strong>,
          mainly through adaptive observer constructions and tools from systems and control.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          Before Toronto, I completed a B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut
          (CGPA 4.0, Dean’s Honor List), and spent a summer at the Adaptive Systems Laboratory at EPFL as an E3 research
          intern working on multi-agent reinforcement learning in decentralized POMDPs.

        <h2>Current themes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive observer–based identification</strong> for stable linear systems, with explicit convergence
            and robustness guarantees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decentralized learning under partial observability</strong>, including policy evaluation, belief
            sharing, and the effect of communication structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared control &amp; HMI</strong> for automated driving, especially handover and driver intention
            recognition in stop–go scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data-informed teaching</strong> in large introductory programming courses, using performance data
            to understand how students interact with mixed-format offerings.
          </li>
