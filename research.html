        <h2>Current themes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive observer–based identification</strong> for stable linear systems, with explicit convergence
            and robustness guarantees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decentralized learning under partial observability</strong>, including policy evaluation, belief
            sharing, and the effect of communication structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared control &amp; HMI</strong> for automated driving, especially handover and driver intention
            recognition in stop–go scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data-informed teaching</strong> in large introductory programming courses, using performance data
            to understand how students interact with mixed-format offerings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where this comes from</h2>
        <p>
          I am part of the Systems Control Group at the University of Toronto, working with
          <strong>Mireille&nbsp;E. Broucke</strong>. My current work combines ideas from classical systems and control,
          observer design, and system identification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that, I worked at the <strong>Adaptive Systems Laboratory (EPFL)</strong> on multi-agent reinforcement
          learning in decentralized POMDPs, and completed my B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
          <strong>American University of Beirut</strong>.
